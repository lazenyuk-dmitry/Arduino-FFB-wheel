This txt file contains details for connecting a second Arduino Uno or Nano board,
that will act as a shift register (button box) inside a custom wheel rim

This sketch emulates Thrustmaster TX RW 458 Italia wheel
allowing to connect arduino to TX RW wheelbase (may work for T500/T300 as well)
and emulate button presses - up to 17 buttons can be connected to arduino, if you
don't need a serial debugging

!!! There are 2 flavours of arduino boards - powered by +5 volts or +3.3 volts !!!
!!! If you have +5V Arduino version - disconnect it from USB before connecting to a wheelbase !!!
!!! Just power your arduino from TX RW wheelbase Black pin - it supplies +3.3V voltage (should be enough) !!!
!!! don't connect USB +5V wire to TX RW wheelbase Black +3.3V - you'll get a collision !!!

Thrustmaster Wheelbase cable pinout (PS/2 connector, also known as mini-Din 6pin female):
1 - Green    - not used
2 - Blue     - GND (ground)
3 - White    - MISO (master in, slave out - to read the data from the wheel)
4 - Orange   - SS (slave select, or PL - parallel load, set it to 0 when you want to read the data)
5 - Red      - CLK (clock impulses)
6 - Black    - +VCC (+3.3 volts! if you have Arduino 5V version - use external +3.3V power or use the wheelbase power!!!)

Arduino UNO pins -> TX RW wheelbase cable pins

Arduino GND                 -> TWRX Blue wire (2)
Arduino pin 12              -> TXRW White wire (3) (data from wheel to base)
Arduino pin 10 + pin 2 (SS) -> TXRW Orange wire pin (4) (yes, on Arduino it's wired to two pins. 10 - SS, 2 - INT0)
Arduino pin 13 (SCK)        -> TXRW Red wire (5)
Arduino +5V                 -> TXRW Black wire (6) (it gives 3.3V, but must be connected into +5V socket on arduino uno side)

Arduino Leonardo FFB (as wheelbase) -> Arduino Nano or UNO (as button box)

Leonardo GND                -> Nano GND
Leonardo 5V		    -> Nano 5V
Leonardo pin 6 (DT_sh)	    -> Nano pin 12
Leonardo pin 7 (CLK_sh)	    -> Nano pin 13
Leonardo pin 8 (PL_sh)	    -> Nano pin 10 and pin 2

Button mappings (we send 8 bytes to wheelbase, first 16 bits are for buttons, the rest are unused - no more pins on nano)
 
Byte 0
  1 – A (button 6)                   -> pin 7 (portD bit7)
  1 – B (button 4)                   -> pin 6 (portD bit6)
  1 – RS (button 12)                 -> pin 5 (portD bit5)
  1 – Menu (button 9)                -> pin 4 (portD bit4)
  1 – Gear Down (button 1 = L_Pad)   -> pin 3 (portD bit3)
  1 – X (button 5)                   -> pin 9 (portB bit1)
  1 – Manettino CCW (button 7, View) -> pin 1 (portD bit1) - if you don't use serial debug (UART TX)
  1 – Manettino CW (button 8, Menu)  -> pin 0 (portD bit0) - if you don't use serial debug (UART RX)

Byte 1
  1 – Gear Up (button 2 = R_Pad)     -> pin 8 (portB bit0)
  1 – Y (button 3)                   -> pin 11 (portB bit3)
  1 – LS (button 11)                 -> pin A5 (portC bit5)
  1 – View (button 10 – under X)     -> pin A4 (portC bit4)
  1 – D-Pad Down                     -> pin A3 (portC bit3)
  1 - D-Pad Right                    -> pin A2 (portC bit2)
  1 - D-Pad Left                     -> pin A1 (portC bit1)
  1 - D-Pad Up                       -> pin A0 (portC bit0)
  
Each push button has 2 pins - you connect one to Arduino, another to the Ground :)
Pressed button gives you "1" (grounded signal), released = "0" (pulled-up to +VCC)
